# NexStride Transportation 🚀

This website was my final project for CS105, a course I took in high school taught by Patrick Young at Stanford.

## 🔧 What I Built

The theme is futuristic/sci-fi transportation. I created multiple pages featuring different modes of transportation, and designed the layout, navigation bar, and booking forms.

### 💡 Design & Resources
- Images: I used a mix of real-life and futuristic concept images found online.
- Navigation bar: I followed tutorials to implement dropdowns and responsive design.
- Cards: Learned to build and style feature cards on the homepage.
- Content: I wrote all the descriptions myself to match the theme and user experience.
